## Predictive Model for Fraud Detection
This project is an example of development of a classification model for fraud detection. It is implemented using Apache Spark, namely, its Python API (pyspark).

Modeling is performed on a small dataset for demonstration purposes. However, the used data is real. Within the project a predictive model is created, then its performance is assessed, and financial impact is evaluated.

The project does not contain extensive exploratary analysis, and most of the variables are hidden because this is commercial information.
